# practice-code-sample
Hello! I've gotten into data analysis and machine learning over the quarantine. This repository contains a few of the projects I've done for the sake of getting practice.
I just work with Python and Jupyter Notebook for now but I'm planning on learning SPSS and R, as those are the languages mostly used in my field (Economics). I'll be trying to decipher more 
economic and social sector data as time goes by.
